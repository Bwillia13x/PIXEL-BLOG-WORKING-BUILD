Final Value = Current Value √ó (1 + Portfolio Drawdown)
Recovery Time = Crisis Duration √ó 0.6 (historical average)
```

### Beta Estimation

- **Defensive Stocks**: 0.4 - 0.7 (lower volatility)
- **Financial Stocks**: 1.2 - 1.7 (market sensitive)
- **General Stocks**: 0.8 - 1.4 (market average)

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Runs 1,000 iterations with ¬±30% volatility around base scenario
- Generates probability distribution of potential outcomes
- Provides confidence intervals for risk assessment
