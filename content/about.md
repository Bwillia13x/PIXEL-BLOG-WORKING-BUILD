# About It From Bit

*"It from bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom... an immaterial source and explanation"* â€” John Wheeler

Welcome to It From Bit, where we explore how information becomes reality through code, markets, and artificial intelligence.

## The Philosophy Behind "It From Bit"

The name comes from physicist John Wheeler's revolutionary insight that all physical phenomenaâ€”all "its"â€”arise from information-theoretic originsâ€”from "bits." This isn't just metaphor; it's a fundamental principle that shapes how we understand reality, computation, and markets.

### Information as Foundation
Wheeler proposed that information is not just about computationâ€”it's about the fabric of reality itself. At It From Bit, we apply this lens to:
- **Code**: Every algorithm encodes patterns that shape digital reality
- **Markets**: Financial systems process information into economic outcomes  
- **AI**: Machine learning discovers information structures in data
- **Quantum Systems**: Information processing at the most fundamental level
