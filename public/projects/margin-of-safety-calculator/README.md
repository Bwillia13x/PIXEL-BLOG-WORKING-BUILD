# Margin of Safety Calculator

## Overview

The **Margin of Safety Calculator** is an advanced value investing tool that uses multiple valuation methodologies to determine the safety margin of potential investments. By employing Monte Carlo simulation and comprehensive risk analysis, it provides investors with a robust framework for making informed decisions.

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è **Multi-Method Valuation**
- **Earnings Power Value (EPV)**: Bruce Greenwald's framework adjusted for quality
- **Graham Number**: Benjamin Graham's intrinsic value formula
- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**: 10-year projection with terminal value
- **Price-to-Book (P/B)**: Asset-based conservative valuation
- **Asset Value**: Liquidation-based downside protection

### üìä **Advanced Analytics**
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 1,000 iterations to model uncertainty
- **Scenario Analysis**: Bull, base, and bear case projections
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Growth rate vs. discount rate impact matrix
- **Risk Decomposition**: Breakdown of valuation, quality, market, and liquidity risks

### üéØ **Safety Margin Assessment**
- **Overall Safety Rating**: Excellent (30%+), Good (15%+), Fair (5%+), Poor (-5%+), Dangerous (below -5%)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Agreement level between valuation methods
- **Risk-Adjusted Analysis**: Quality score integration for enhanced accuracy

## Valuation Methodologies

### 1. Earnings Power Value (EPV)
```
EPV = Normalized EPS / Discount Rate
Normalized EPS = EPS √ó (1 + (Quality Score - 70) / 200)
```

### 2. Graham Number
```
Graham Number = ‚àö(22.5 √ó EPS √ó Book Value Per Share)
```

### 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
```
DCF = Œ£(FCF √ó (1 + g)^t / (1 + r)^t) + Terminal Value
Terminal Value = FCF‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ √ó Terminal Multiple / (1 + r)^10
```

### 4. Price-to-Book Analysis
```
P/B Value = Book Value Per Share √ó 1.5 (Conservative Multiple)
```

### 5. Asset-Based Valuation
```
Asset Value = Book Value Per Share √ó 0.8 (Liquidation Value)
```

## Risk Analysis Framework

### Risk Components
1. **Valuation Risk**: Overvaluation based on margin calculations
2. **Quality Risk**: Disagreement between valuation methods
3. **Market Risk**: Systematic market exposure (25% baseline)
4. **Liquidity Risk**: Trading volume and market depth (15% baseline)

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- **1,000 iterations** with ¬±20% volatility
- **Histogram distribution** of potential outcomes
- **Probability assessment** of achieving target margins

- **Validation**: Input validation and error handling
- **Consistency**: Standardized formatting across all outputs

## Value Investing Philosophy

The Margin of Safety Calculator embodies key principles of value investing:

1. **Margin of Safety**: Benjamin Graham's core principle of buying below intrinsic value
2. **Multiple Methods**: Reducing single-point-of-failure risk through diversified valuation
3. **Quality Integration**: Recognizing that quality companies deserve premium valuations
4. **Risk Awareness**: Explicit modeling of uncertainty and downside scenarios
5. **Conservative Assumptions**: Bias toward prudent estimates and downside protection
