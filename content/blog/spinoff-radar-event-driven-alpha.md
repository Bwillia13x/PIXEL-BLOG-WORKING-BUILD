## Elevator Pitch: Don't Miss the Hidden Gems

**Spinoff Radar** is an event-driven investment tool designed to ensure investors never miss value-unlocking catalysts like corporate spin-offs. The elevator pitch is simple: *Major value can be unlocked when companies spin off divisions, but these opportunities are often overlooked in the flood of market news.* This platform acts as an "alpha radar" for spin-offs, scanning the horizon for upcoming or recent separations that could create mispriced stocks. Investors often lack the time to sift through countless SEC filings or news articles – Spinoff Radar does it for them, surfacing actionable insights. By consolidating **SEC/SEDAR filings, corporate announcements, and market data**, it highlights when a parent-child separation might lead to *undervalued "children" or refocused "parents."* In essence, Spinoff Radar helps investors **capitalize on special situations** that traditional screens might miss, bridging the information gap and giving an edge in event-driven strategy.

**Pain Point:** Studies have shown that spin-offs frequently outperform the market, yet many investors miss out because information is scattered or timing is tricky. The tool's creation was motivated by the fact that *spin-off opportunities are underfollowed and often misunderstood*, despite well-documented excess returns. Spinoff Radar aims to fix that by being the dedicated tracker and analyzer of these events, turning a complex research process into a one-stop dashboard.

## Spinoff Alpha: Historical Performance Background

Investors have long suspected spin-offs are fertile ground for alpha, and research confirms it. **Academic and industry studies overwhelmingly find that spin-off stocks outperform.** A 25-year Penn State study found that spun-off companies beat their industry peers and the S&P 500 by roughly **10% *per year*** on average. Similarly, a Purdue University study spanning 36 years (1965–2000, extended to 2013) showed spin-offs delivered **excess returns >10% annually above the market**. In practical terms, what looks like a corporate reshuffling often results in two more focused businesses that the market initially misprices.

Why do spin-offs generate such high returns? The evidence suggests a few reasons:

* **Initial Underpricing:** When a division is spun off to shareholders, many recipients didn't ask for it and quickly sell – pushing the price down below fair value. Institutional investors often *can't* hold small spin-offs (not in indices, or too small for mandate), causing forced selling. This supply-demand quirk leaves spin-offs undervalued initially.

* **Focused Management:** Post-spin, the new standalone companies can pursue strategies independently, often unlocking growth or efficiencies that were hidden under the conglomerate umbrella. Incentives (management stock options based on the new stock) further drive performance.

* **Lack of Coverage:** Spin-offs tend to have little or no analyst coverage at first. They fly under Wall Street's radar, so price discovery is slow. Only after the first few earnings reports (when data starts showing up in screeners and analysts initiate coverage) do they get recognized – by then early investors may have already reaped gains.

Concrete examples illustrate the magnitude of these opportunities. Here's a table of a few notable spin-offs and their post-separation performance:

| Parent Company (Spin Year) | Spinoff Entity                              | Post-Spin Performance                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HCA Healthcare (1999)      | *LifePoint Hospitals* and *Triad Hospitals* | $2,000 in each grew to **$7,300** in 3 years (≈265% return). Both hospital operators thrived independently in niche markets.                                                             |
| Texas Industries (2005)    | *Chaparral Steel*                           | $2,000 became **$15,305** in <2 years (≈665% return). Spin-off was later bought out at a high premium.                                                                                   |
| RPC, Inc. (2001)           | *Marine Products Corp.*                     | $2,000 grew to **$12,785** in 3 years (≈539% return). A mundane business (boat manufacturing) gained 6x as a focused entity.                                                             |
| eBay (2015)                | *PayPal Holdings*                           | PayPal's stock rose ~+66% in its first year post-spin, far outperforming eBay. It unlocked value as a pure-play payments company, now worth significantly more than eBay's remaining biz. |

These examples underscore a pattern: **spin-offs often start as "ugly ducklings" (low price, little fanfare) but rapidly appreciate as independent companies.** In fact, one study noted that an index of spin-offs outperformed the S&P 500 by over **13%** in the first year after spin-off, on average. Even the S&P's own U.S. Spin-Off Index routinely shows better returns than the broad market.

All this sets the context: there is alpha to be captured, if one can spot spin-offs early and analyze them properly. Spinoff Radar's mission is to make sure you do exactly that.

## Feature Set of Spinoff Radar

Spinoff Radar's core features are built around the lifecycle of a spin-off event – from detection, through analysis, to monitoring:

* **SEC & SEDAR Filings Scraping:** The platform continuously monitors regulatory filings for any hints of spin-off activity. This includes initial Form 10 registration statements, Form 8-K announcements of intended separations, proxy statements mentioning spin-off votes, etc. The moment a company files a document indicating a planned spin-off, the system flags it.

* **Event Calendar & Alerts:** All identified spin-offs populate a centralized **Spinoff Calendar**. This calendar lists upcoming key dates: when-issued trading start, distribution date, when the spin-off will trade regular-way, etc. Users can subscribe to specific events or companies to get alerts so they won't miss critical dates.

* **Sentiment-Scored News Feed:** Spinoff Radar aggregates news articles, press releases, and even social media mentions for companies undergoing or recently completing spin-offs. Each news item is run through a sentiment analysis engine to gauge tone – positive, neutral, or negative – and is tagged accordingly.

* **Valuation & KPI Dashboard:** For each spin-off, Spinoff Radar provides key financial metrics and valuation snapshots. This includes pro-forma financials when available from filings, and shows comparative **valuation multiples** – e.g. what P/E or EV/EBITDA the spin-off might trade at versus its industry peers.

* **Peer Comparison & Case Studies:** The platform has a knowledge base of historical spin-offs and their outcomes. If you're analyzing a new industrial conglomerate spin-off, Spinoff Radar might surface similar past cases via similarity search on descriptions.

* **Watchlist & Portfolio Tracking:** Users can add spin-off situations to a personal watchlist. The platform will then continuously track those – showing real-time quotes for parent and spun-off stock once trading, the aggregate performance vs if you'd held the original company, etc.

## Architecture Snapshot

Spinoff Radar's architecture is built with a **modern web stack optimized for real-time data and developer velocity**:

* **Frontend:** Implemented in **Next.js 15** (React framework) with **shadcn/ui** for a clean, accessible design. The interface has interactive components: calendars, charts, and tables that update live.

* **Backend API:** Uses **tRPC** (type-safe RPC) with Next.js API routes. This means the frontend and backend share type definitions, allowing seamless calls without needing to write REST endpoints manually.

* **Database:** Spinoff data is stored in **PostgreSQL**. Prisma ORM is used for interacting with the database in a type-safe manner. The schema includes tables for companies, spin-off events, filings, news articles, and user data.

* **Workers & Scheduling:** For continuous monitoring of filings and news, a background **Node-Cron** worker is deployed that runs scheduled jobs to scrape EDGAR, check SEDAR, and pull news feeds.

* **Natural Language Processing:** Heavy NLP tasks are handled by a separate Python service using **Hugging Face Transformers** to generate MiniLM embeddings and sentiment scores.

* **Vector Database:** The platform uses **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** for generating embeddings stored in a **Pinecone** vector database, enabling the "similar past cases" feature.
