# Quality Score Engine (QSE)

## Overview

The Quality Score Engine is a sophisticated value investing analysis tool that combines Benjamin Graham's defensive investing principles with modern AI-powered pattern recognition. It evaluates companies across 12 key quality dimensions to generate a comprehensive Quality Score (0-100) that helps investors identify high-quality businesses.

## Core Philosophy

6. **Dividend Reliability** - Payment history and coverage
